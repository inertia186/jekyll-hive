# Jekyll::Hive

Liquid tag for displaying Hive content in Jekyll sites: `{% hive %}`.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/inertia186/jekyll-hive.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/inertia186/jekyll-hive)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```bash
gem 'jekyll-hive'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install jekyll-hive
```

Then add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

```yml
plugins:
  - jekyll-hive
```

ðŸ’¡ If you are using a Jekyll version less than 3.5.0, use the `gems` key instead of `plugins`.

## Usage

Use the tag as follows in your Jekyll pages, posts and collections:

```liquid
{% hive author/permlink %}
```
This will place the associated content on the page.

## Note About Turbolinks

If you're using Turbolinks on your Jekyll site, you should consider adding the following line to your main includes, e.g. `_includes/head.html`:

```html
<script src='https://unpkg.com/steem-content-renderer'></script>
```

## Jekyll Build

When building your site with jekyll, you can continue to use the default command:

```bash
jekyll build
```

If you would like to provide an alternate node:

```bash
NODE_URL=https://anyx.io jekyll build
```

## Jekyll Clean

To completely rebuild your site without cache:

```bash
rm -rf .jekyll-hive-cache && jekyll clean && jekyll build
```

## Troubleshooting

#### I saw several messages like:

```
Retrying: stoodkev/how-to-use-hivejs-or-other-modules-referencing-core-node-js-modules-on-react-native (Failed to open TCP connection to api.hive.blog:443 (getaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known))

```

Check your internet connection or provide an alternate node:

```
NODE_URL=https://anyx.io jekyll build
```

#### The post has changed on the blockchain, but `jekyll-hive` won't update to the latest post revision.

The cached copy is out of date.  Try deleting the related post from the cache or remove the entire cache:

```
rm -rf .jekyll-hive-cache
```
