        we have done since the beginning, we burned another 10% chunk of the STEM
        sell wall.  This burn was for **177,000 STEM tokens**.  This reduces the sell
        wall to **1,603,000 STEM** from the original 2,500,00 STEM.\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/vj1cQBI.png\n\nWe
        also burned 4B STEM tokens in the beginning to drastically reduce the max
        supply to a reasonable level.\n\nAs promised, we will continue to burn @stemgeeks
        author rewards and @stemcuration curation rewards.\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ngbHf5t.png\n\nI
        have seen a few users use the **burn for promotion functionality**.  Just
        send STEM token to @null with the post you want to promote in the memo field
        and you will increase your posts ranking on trending.\n\nWe have burned over
        4B tokens out of the 5B max supply.\n\nSTEM Miner tokens have been drastically
        reduced as well and are only available in limited qualities.  Starting January
        1st, 2020, the STEM Miner token **will go up 33% to 20 STEEM**.  There is
        a very limited supply of STEM Miner tokens available as the vast majority
        of them have been burned.  More will be slowly added to the market based on
        performance over the next 4 days period to the price increase.\n\nSTEM Miners
        are one of the lowest supply Miner tokens available.\n\n**There are only 4
        days to get STEM Miner tokens for 15 STEEM.**","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"stemgeeks\",\"steemleo\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"burn\",\"stemtoken\",\"stem\"],\"users\":[\"stemgeeks\",\"stemcuration\",\"null\"],\"image\":[\"https:\/\/cdn.steemitimages.com\/DQmWfQdaKD1K1T69KW6uNFLmZKYuHZcF8BtEaa8sZxEmETM\/image.png\",\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/vj1cQBI.png\",\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ngbHf5t.png\"],\"app\":\"stemgeeks\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"canonical_url\":\"https:\/\/stemgeeks.net\/@stemgeeks\/177-000-stem-burned-and-stem-miner-price-increase-in-2020\"}","last_update":"2019-12-27T11:48:42","created":"2019-12-27T11:48:42","active":"2020-01-13T14:34:18","last_payout":"2020-01-03T11:48:42","depth":0,"children":4,"net_rshares":0,"abs_rshares":0,"vote_rshares":0,"children_abs_rshares":0,"cashout_time":"1969-12-31T23:59:59","max_cashout_time":"1969-12-31T23:59:59","total_vote_weight":0,"reward_weight":10000,"total_payout_value":"2.214
